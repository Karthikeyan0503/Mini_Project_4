Tourism Experience Analytics: Classification, Prediction, and Recommendation System

Problem Statement:
Tourism agencies and travel platforms aim to enhance user experiences by leveraging data to provide personalized recommendations, predict user satisfaction, and classify potential user behavior. This project involves analyzing user preferences, travel patterns, and attraction features to achieve three primary objectives: regression, classification, and recommendation.

Datasets:
The dataset used for this project contains information about users focusing the users visited places, rating, attraction, region, country, etc. Initially, the dataset was in Excel file which was preprocessed to remove missing values, normalize features, and prepare it for training machine learning models using Python.

EDA & Preprocessing:
Before training machine learning models, the dataset underwent preprocessing steps to ensure its suitability for model training. This included handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables. Python libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn were utilized for these preprocessing tasks.
